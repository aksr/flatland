Flatland (Kindle)
========

Flatland - Edwin A. Abbott, a LaTeX version for Kindle 

A (somewhat) quick hack for now.

Rationale
---------

A fork of [https://github.com/Ivesvdf/flatland].

Fixed many spelling issues and added a few missing words.  
Added custom class (modified book.cls) class for kindle.  
Further progress planned.  

Future
------

Further progress on Kindle class etc.  
Maybe make a template out of it?  
Further work needed on drawings.  
Maybe it doesn't have to be only for Kindle?  

Misc
----
Fonts could be bigger (10pt -> 12pt).
